# Embracing College Technical Communities: Where Capabilities Take the Spotlight

<p style="text-align: justified;">
  Joining technical communities in college can sometimes feel like navigating a political landscape, with hidden agendas and power plays. However, there are exceptional organizations that prioritize merit and capabilities above all else. I had the privilege of being part of one such organization that valued skills without getting entangled in politics.<br>
  <br>
  During the selection process, I was presented with a series of tasks that truly put my abilities to the test. First, I had to deploy a node application on Heroku, a SaaS platform where I was able to demonstrate my ability to deploy automated CI/CD pipelines. This task showcased my technical prowess and ability to handle real-world scenarios.<br>
  <br>
  Additionally, a crucial aspect of the assessment was the UI/UX evaluation. I was tasked with designing widgets, highlighting my creative problem-solving skills and attention to detail in crafting user-friendly interfaces. This assessment served as a testament to my understanding of user experience and my ability to translate concepts into visually appealing and functional designs.<br>

  The organization I joined recognized the significance of these practical tasks as indicators of potential and capabilities. Their selection process focused on skills, allowing me to showcase my abilities rather than getting caught up in political dynamics.<br>
  <br>
  Being a member of this organization has been an enriching experience. It has provided me with opportunities to further develop my technical skills, collaborate with like-minded peers, and contribute to meaningful projects. The absence of politics in the decision-making process has fostered an environment where dedication and hard work are valued, enabling individuals to thrive based on their merits.<br>
  <br>
  In conclusion, my involvement in this organization has been a refreshing reminder that certain communities prioritize capabilities above political maneuvering. It serves as a testament to the fact that in the right environment, individuals can showcase their talents and skills to their fullest potential. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a community and look forward to the continued growth and success it offers.<br>
